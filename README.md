# NET207 | Monitoring and troubleshooting your cloud network on AWS

### Session Abstract

In the cloud, make failure your friend. When network issues arise on and
off the cloud, having the right diagnostic tools is crucial for quick
resolution. In this interactive session, discover how to proactively
monitor and swiftly troubleshoot cloud and hybrid networks on AWS. Learn
to leverage services like Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor, Amazon
CloudWatch Internet Monitor, Infrastructure Performance, VPC
Reachability Analyzer, and VPC Flow Logs to gain deep visibility,
identify impairments, and resolve problems efficiently. Walk away
empowered to maintain a bird's eye view and optimize your cloud
network's reliability, performance, and cost-effectiveness.
